# 100DaysofRTL
"100 days of RTL" is a personal project to learn Verilog HDL RTL design in 100 days, using Xilinx Vivado
Hi, I'm Soumyadeep Singh, and I'm currently immersing myself in the world of VLSI, focusing on RTL design using Verilog HDL. My goal is to learn RTL within 1️⃣0️⃣0️⃣ days, and I rely on Xilinx Vivado 2022.2 Design Suite for synthesizing and simulating RTL codes. This powerful tool allows me to efficiently develop complex digital circuits, including FPGAs and ASICs. I'm excited about my journey and the potential it holds for equipping me with valuable skills that I can apply to real-world problems in the future.
Here is the list of Day wise RTL Codes:-

Day: 1-> Majority Circuit
